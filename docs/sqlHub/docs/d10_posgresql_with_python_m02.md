## Concept

Using python I want to create database sqlite with sqlachemy 2.0 then instruct
me how to import the data from pd.dataframe to this database using ORM make an
example of data of 10 entries for example for employee include first name last
name, salary, gender, age, status, timestamp of created, time he/she join the
company ..etc

To create a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy 2.0 and import data from a
`pandas.DataFrame` to this database using SQLAlchemy's ORM, you can follow these
steps:

### 1. Install the Required Libraries

First, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy pandas
```

### 2. Define the Database Model

Here’s how you can define an `Employee` model with fields such as `first_name`,
`last_name`, `salary`, `gender`, `age`, `status`, `created_at`, and `joined_at`.

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, Float, DateTime
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from datetime import datetime
import pandas as pd

# Define the SQLite database
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///employees.db')
Base = declarative_base()

# Define the Employee model
class Employee(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'employees'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    first_name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    last_name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    salary = Column(Float, nullable=False)
    gender = Column(String, nullable=False)
    age = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
    status = Column(String, nullable=False)
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    joined_at = Column(DateTime, nullable=False)

# Create the table
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

### 3. Create a Sample DataFrame

Let’s create a sample `pandas.DataFrame` with 10 entries for employees.

```python
data = {
    'first_name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'David', 'Eva', 'Frank', 'Grace', 'Henry', 'Ivy', 'John'],
    'last_name': ['Smith', 'Brown', 'Davis', 'Miller', 'Wilson', 'Moore', 'Taylor', 'Anderson', 'Thomas', 'Jackson'],
    'salary': [60000, 50000, 70000, 48000, 55000, 67000, 62000, 53000, 59000, 75000],
    'gender': ['F', 'M', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'M'],
    'age': [29, 34, 27, 40, 32, 36, 28, 45, 30, 50],
    'status': ['active', 'active', 'inactive', 'active', 'inactive', 'active', 'inactive', 'active', 'inactive', 'active'],
    'created_at': [datetime.now() for _ in range(10)],
    'joined_at': [datetime(2020, 5, i + 1) for i in range(10)]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

### 4. Insert Data from DataFrame into the Database

Now, let’s insert this data into the SQLite database using SQLAlchemy.

```python
# Set up the session
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

# Insert each row from the DataFrame as an Employee record
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    employee = Employee(
        first_name=row['first_name'],
        last_name=row['last_name'],
        salary=row['salary'],
        gender=row['gender'],
        age=row['age'],
        status=row['status'],
        created_at=row['created_at'],
        joined_at=row['joined_at']
    )
    session.add(employee)

# Commit the session to the database
session.commit()
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Database and Model Setup**: We create a SQLite database with SQLAlchemy’s
   `create_engine` and define an `Employee` class representing our data
   structure.
2. **DataFrame Creation**: A sample `pandas.DataFrame` with 10 entries is
   created with employee information.
3. **Data Insertion**: We iterate over each row of the DataFrame, create an
   `Employee` object, and add it to the session. After all entries are added,
   `session.commit()` saves them to the database.

This example should create an SQLite database named `employees.db` with the data
from the `pandas.DataFrame`. You can modify the data as needed or expand the
model with more fields if required.

## Q - What if i have two tables one for emp info and one for emp activities?

If you have two tables, one for `Employee` info and another for
`EmployeeActivity`, you can establish a relationship between them. Typically,
`EmployeeActivity` would reference `Employee` by an `employee_id` foreign key,
allowing you to link activities to specific employees.

Here’s how to modify the code:

### 1. Define the Database Models

We’ll define two models: `Employee` and `EmployeeActivity`. The
`EmployeeActivity` table will have a foreign key pointing to `Employee`.

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, Float, DateTime, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship, sessionmaker
from datetime import datetime
import pandas as pd

# Define the SQLite database
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///employees.db')
Base = declarative_base()

# Define the Employee model
class Employee(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'employees'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    first_name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    last_name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    salary = Column(Float, nullable=False)
    gender = Column(String, nullable=False)
    age = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
    status = Column(String, nullable=False)
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    joined_at = Column(DateTime, nullable=False)

    # Relationship with EmployeeActivity
    activities = relationship('EmployeeActivity', back_populates='employee')

# Define the EmployeeActivity model
class EmployeeActivity(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'employee_activities'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    employee_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('employees.id'), nullable=False)
    activity_date = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    activity_type = Column(String, nullable=False)
    description = Column(String, nullable=True)

    # Relationship back to Employee
    employee = relationship('Employee', back_populates='activities')

# Create the tables
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

### 2. Create Sample DataFrames

Let’s create two DataFrames: one for employee information and another for employee activities.

#### Employee Information DataFrame

```python
employee_data = {
    'first_name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'David', 'Eva', 'Frank', 'Grace', 'Henry', 'Ivy', 'John'],
    'last_name': ['Smith', 'Brown', 'Davis', 'Miller', 'Wilson', 'Moore', 'Taylor', 'Anderson', 'Thomas', 'Jackson'],
    'salary': [60000, 50000, 70000, 48000, 55000, 67000, 62000, 53000, 59000, 75000],
    'gender': ['F', 'M', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'M'],
    'age': [29, 34, 27, 40, 32, 36, 28, 45, 30, 50],
    'status': ['active', 'active', 'inactive', 'active', 'inactive', 'active', 'inactive', 'active', 'inactive', 'active'],
    'created_at': [datetime.now() for _ in range(10)],
    'joined_at': [datetime(2020, 5, i + 1) for i in range(10)]
}
df_employees = pd.DataFrame(employee_data)
```

#### Employee Activities DataFrame

```python
activity_data = {
    'employee_id': [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],  # Assume these IDs correspond to Employee table primary keys
    'activity_date': [datetime.now() for _ in range(10)],
    'activity_type': ['Meeting', 'Training', 'Meeting', 'Workshop', 'Training', 'Meeting', 'Workshop', 'Training', 'Workshop', 'Meeting'],
    'description': ['Project discussion', 'Safety training', 'Team meeting', 'Skills workshop', 'Compliance training', 'Project update', 'Professional development', 'Role-specific training', 'Management skills', 'Monthly review']
}
df_activities = pd.DataFrame(activity_data)
```

### 3. Insert Data into the Database

Now, let’s insert both employees and activities into the database, linking activities to specific employees.

```python
# Set up the session
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

# Insert Employee records
employees = []
for _, row in df_employees.iterrows():
    employee = Employee(
        first_name=row['first_name'],
        last_name=row['last_name'],
        salary=row['salary'],
        gender=row['gender'],
        age=row['age'],
        status=row['status'],
        created_at=row['created_at'],
        joined_at=row['joined_at']
    )
    session.add(employee)
    employees.append(employee)  # Add to list to reference by index later

# Commit employees to generate IDs
session.commit()

# Insert EmployeeActivity records using employee IDs
for _, row in df_activities.iterrows():
    activity = EmployeeActivity(
        employee_id=row['employee_id'],
        activity_date=row['activity_date'],
        activity_type=row['activity_type'],
        description=row['description']
    )
    session.add(activity)

# Commit activities to the database
session.commit()
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Model Setup**: `Employee` and `EmployeeActivity` models are defined, with
   `EmployeeActivity` containing a foreign key to `Employee` (`employee_id`).
   The relationship is bidirectional, allowing access from `Employee` to
   `EmployeeActivity` and vice versa.
2. **Data Insertion**: After inserting employees, `session.commit()` is called
   to save them and generate their IDs. Then we insert `EmployeeActivity`
   records, linking each activity to an employee by referencing their
   `employee_id`.

This setup creates two tables in `employees.db`, one for employee information
and one for their activities, with activities linked to specific employees via
the foreign key. You can modify the data as necessary for more complex
structures.

## Is there a better way instead of itertool for dataframe to be loaded to sql?

There’s a more efficient way to insert a large number of records from a
DataFrame into an SQL database with SQLAlchemy. Instead of iterating over each
row with `iterrows`, you can use SQLAlchemy’s `session.bulk_insert_mappings()`
or `session.bulk_save_objects()`. Both methods are optimized for batch inserts
and can significantly improve performance, especially with large DataFrames.

Here’s how you can use `bulk_insert_mappings` to insert data without looping
over each row:

### Using `bulk_insert_mappings`

With `bulk_insert_mappings`, you can directly map each DataFrame row to the
model's columns in a batch, without creating each ORM object individually.

```python
# Convert DataFrame to a list of dictionaries for bulk insert
employee_data = df_employees.to_dict(orient="records")

# Use bulk_insert_mappings to insert all rows at once
session.bulk_insert_mappings(Employee, employee_data)
session.commit()
```

### Using `bulk_save_objects`

Alternatively, if you still need to use ORM objects (for example, if you need
additional processing on each object), you can use `bulk_save_objects`.

```python
# Convert each DataFrame row to an Employee object
employees = [
    Employee(
        first_name=row['first_name'],
        last_name=row['last_name'],
        salary=row['salary'],
        gender=row['gender'],
        age=row['age'],
        status=row['status'],
        created_at=row['created_at'],
        joined_at=row['joined_at']
    )
    for row in df_employees.to_dict(orient="records")
]

# Use bulk_save_objects to insert all Employee objects at once
session.bulk_save_objects(employees)
session.commit()
```

### Inserting Related Records with Foreign Keys

For the `EmployeeActivity` table, if it relies on existing `employee_id` values,
ensure you have the necessary IDs already in the `employee_data` DataFrame
before bulk-inserting. You can then follow the same approach with
`bulk_insert_mappings`:

```python
# Convert EmployeeActivity DataFrame to list of dictionaries
activity_data = df_activities.to_dict(orient="records")

# Insert all activity records at once
session.bulk_insert_mappings(EmployeeActivity, activity_data)
session.commit()
```

### Benefits of Bulk Insert Methods

- **Performance**: These methods are optimized for batch inserts, reducing the
  overhead of individual insert operations.
- **Cleaner Code**: This approach avoids loops, making the code more readable
  and concise.
- **Transaction Management**: By committing once at the end, it handles all
  records in a single transaction, ensuring data integrity and faster execution.

## Q Now how I can load the full table , data mart that is loaded completely to pad dataframe?

To load a complete table from your SQLite database into a `pandas.DataFrame`,
you can use SQLAlchemy's connection with `pandas.read_sql_table`. This will
allow you to fetch the entire table in one step and load it into a DataFrame.

Here's how to do it:

### 1. Establish a Connection to the Database

First, ensure you have SQLAlchemy and `pandas` installed.

### 2. Load the Table into a DataFrame

To load the `Employee` or `EmployeeActivity` table into a `pandas.DataFrame`,
use the `read_sql_table` method provided by `pandas`.

Here's an example:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Define the SQLite database
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///employees.db')

# Load the Employee table into a DataFrame
df_employees = pd.read_sql_table('employees', con=engine)

# Load the EmployeeActivity table into a DataFrame
df_activities = pd.read_sql_table('employee_activities', con=engine)
```

### Explanation

- **`read_sql_table`**: This method reads the entire table specified by its name
  and returns it as a `pandas.DataFrame`. It’s a convenient way to load complete
  tables.
- **Connection**: The `con=engine` argument provides the connection to your
  SQLite database.

### Example of Loaded Data

Once loaded, `df_employees` and `df_activities` will contain the full data from
their respective tables in `pandas.DataFrame` format. You can now analyze,
manipulate, or merge these DataFrames as needed.

### Additional Options

If you only need specific columns or rows, consider using
`pandas.read_sql_query` with a custom SQL query. For example:

```python
# Load specific columns or rows using a custom SQL query
df_selected = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees WHERE age > 30", con=engine)
```

This approach is flexible and efficient for loading data from a database into
`pandas`.

## Is there a way to query these two table and make a one table?

Yes, you can use SQL joins to query both tables (`employees` and
`employee_activities`) and create a single combined table. This can be done with
`pandas.read_sql_query()` to directly execute a SQL join query and load the
result into a single `pandas.DataFrame`.

Here’s how to do it:

### 1. Using an SQL Join to Combine the Tables

You can join `employees` and `employee_activities` on the `employee_id` field
(assuming `employee_id` is the foreign key in the `employee_activities` table
that references the `id` column in `employees`). This will allow you to create a
combined dataset containing employee details along with their activities.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Define the SQLite database
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///employees.db')

# SQL query to join both tables
query = """
SELECT e.id AS employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.salary, e.gender, e.age, e.status, e.created_at, e.joined_at,
       a.activity_date, a.activity_type, a.description
FROM employees e
JOIN employee_activities a ON e.id = a.employee_id
"""

# Load the combined data into a DataFrame
df_combined = pd.read_sql_query(query, con=engine)
```

### Explanation of the Query

- **Join Condition**: `JOIN employee_activities a ON e.id = a.employee_id` joins each employee with their activities using `id` as the primary key in `employees` and `employee_id` as the foreign key in `employee_activities`.
- **Selected Columns**: We select relevant columns from both `employees` (`e`) and `employee_activities` (`a`) to include in the final output.

### Example Result

The resulting `df_combined` DataFrame will have columns from both tables, like:

| employee_id | first_name | last_name | salary | gender | age | status | created_at | joined_at | activity_date | activity_type | description        |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- | ------ | ------ | --- | ------ | ---------- | --------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| 1           | Alice      | Smith     | 60000  | F      | 29  | active | ...        | ...       | ...           | Meeting       | Project discussion |
| 2           | Bob        | Brown     | 50000  | M      | 34  | active | ...        | ...       | ...           | Training      | Safety training    |
| ...         | ...        | ...       | ...    | ...    | ... | ...    | ...        | ...       | ...           | ...           | ...                |

### Additional Options

You can modify the query as needed, for example:

- **Filtering Rows**: Add a `WHERE` clause to filter specific employees or activities.
- **Grouping**: Use `GROUP BY` to aggregate data, such as counting activities per employee.

This approach provides a powerful way to analyze data from both tables in a single DataFrame.

## So the first-name can be duplicated?

Yes, in a joined table like the one we created, it’s possible for `first_name`
(or any other employee-specific field) to appear multiple times because an
employee can have multiple activities. Each activity will result in a new row
for that employee in the joined table, so their `first_name`, `last_name`, and
other details will repeat for each related activity.

If you want to reduce duplication and still display all activities for each
employee, here are a couple of approaches you could take:

### 1. Group Activities into a Single Row per Employee

You can aggregate activities into a single row per employee, concatenating their
activities into a single field. Here’s how to do that:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Define the SQLite database
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///employees.db')

# SQL query to join both tables
query = """
SELECT e.id AS employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.salary, e.gender, e.age, e.status, e.created_at, e.joined_at,
       a.activity_date, a.activity_type, a.description
FROM employees e
JOIN employee_activities a ON e.id = a.employee_id
"""

# Load the data into a DataFrame
df_combined = pd.read_sql_query(query, con=engine)

# Group by employee details, concatenating activities into lists
df_grouped = df_combined.groupby(
    ['employee_id', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'salary', 'gender', 'age', 'status', 'created_at', 'joined_at']
).agg({
    'activity_date': list,
    'activity_type': list,
    'description': list
}).reset_index()
```

In `df_grouped`, each employee will have a single row, and their activities (`activity_date`, `activity_type`, and `description`) will be stored as lists. Here’s an example of what it might look like:

| employee_id | first_name | last_name | salary | gender | age | status | created_at | joined_at | activity_date       | activity_type             | description         |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- | ------ | ------ | --- | ------ | ---------- | --------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1           | Alice      | Smith     | 60000  | F      | 29  | active | ...        | ...       | [date1, date2, ...] | [Meeting, Training, ...]  | [desc1, desc2, ...] |
| 2           | Bob        | Brown     | 50000  | M      | 34  | active | ...        | ...       | [date1, date2, ...] | [Training, Workshop, ...] | [desc1, desc2, ...] |

### 2. Pivot Activities by Type

If you have specific activity types and want them as columns instead of rows, you could pivot the data. For example, if employees can only have one of each activity type, you could pivot them to separate columns.

```python
# Pivot data with employee details as the index
df_pivoted = df_combined.pivot_table(
    index=['employee_id', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'salary', 'gender', 'age', 'status', 'created_at', 'joined_at'],
    columns='activity_type',
    values='description',
    aggfunc='first'  # Or use ' '.join for concatenation if there are multiple descriptions per type
).reset_index()
```

This approach would make each activity type a separate column, though it’s only
suitable if each employee has at most one record per activity type.

These methods help you reduce duplication of employee data while retaining their
activities in a structured format within a `pandas.DataFrame`.

## Is there a way that i can create the table in orm before send it to pd dataframe?

Yes, you can create a new ORM model that represents the joined data, and then
insert data into it by querying the existing tables and processing the results.
This approach allows you to work with the joined data as a table in your
database, which you can then easily load into a `pandas.DataFrame`.

Here’s how you can do it:

### 1. Define a New ORM Model for the Joined Table

First, define a new model in SQLAlchemy that will represent the joined data.

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, Float, DateTime, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship, sessionmaker
from datetime import datetime

# Define the SQLite database
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///employees.db')
Base = declarative_base()

# Define the Employee model (existing)
class Employee(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'employees'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    first_name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    last_name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    salary = Column(Float, nullable=False)
    gender = Column(String, nullable=False)
    age = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
    status = Column(String, nullable=False)
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    joined_at = Column(DateTime, nullable=False)

    activities = relationship('EmployeeActivity', back_populates='employee')

# Define the EmployeeActivity model (existing)
class EmployeeActivity(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'employee_activities'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    employee_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('employees.id'), nullable=False)
    activity_date = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    activity_type = Column(String, nullable=False)
    description = Column(String, nullable=True)

    employee = relationship('Employee', back_populates='activities')

# Define a new model for the joined table (combined employee and activity data)
class EmployeeActivitySummary(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'employee_activity_summary'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    employee_id = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
    first_name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    last_name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    salary = Column(Float, nullable=False)
    gender = Column(String, nullable=False)
    age = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
    status = Column(String, nullable=False)
    created_at = Column(DateTime)
    joined_at = Column(DateTime)
    activity_date = Column(DateTime)
    activity_type = Column(String)
    description = Column(String)

# Create all tables, including the new summary table
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

### 2. Populate the New Table with Joined Data

Now, you can query `employees` and `employee_activities` tables, join them, and
insert the results into `employee_activity_summary`.

```python
# Set up the session
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

# Query and join employees with their activities
joined_data = session.query(
    Employee.id.label('employee_id'),
    Employee.first_name,
    Employee.last_name,
    Employee.salary,
    Employee.gender,
    Employee.age,
    Employee.status,
    Employee.created_at,
    Employee.joined_at,
    EmployeeActivity.activity_date,
    EmployeeActivity.activity_type,
    EmployeeActivity.description
).join(EmployeeActivity, Employee.id == EmployeeActivity.employee_id).all()

# Insert joined data into EmployeeActivitySummary table
for row in joined_data:
    summary_record = EmployeeActivitySummary(
        employee_id=row.employee_id,
        first_name=row.first_name,
        last_name=row.last_name,
        salary=row.salary,
        gender=row.gender,
        age=row.age,
        status=row.status,
        created_at=row.created_at,
        joined_at=row.joined_at,
        activity_date=row.activity_date,
        activity_type=row.activity_type,
        description=row.description
    )
    session.add(summary_record)

# Commit to save the new records
session.commit()
```

### 3. Load the New Summary Table into a `pandas.DataFrame`

Once the data is stored in the `employee_activity_summary` table, you can easily
load it into a `pandas.DataFrame`:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the summary table into a DataFrame
df_summary = pd.read_sql_table('employee_activity_summary', con=engine)
```

### Explanation

1. **New Model Definition**: `EmployeeActivitySummary` represents the joined
   data. It includes fields from both `Employee` and `EmployeeActivity`.
2. **Query and Insert Data**: We query the `employees` and `employee_activities`
   tables, perform a join, and insert the results into
   `employee_activity_summary`.
3. **Data Loading**: With the joined data saved as its own table, it’s simple to
   load into `pandas`.

This approach provides a flexible way to work with joined data as a standalone
table, which can be queried, updated, and loaded into `pandas` efficiently.

## Deep Understanding

Explain more in orm about the relationship:

- How to understand it, how to create it, what is the abastract formula is it
  always calling the class name and the use back like
- Employee = relationship('Employee', back_populates='activities')
- Give me the abastract formula can work for any relationship
- Then show how this will cover all types of relationships
- One to one , one to many , many to many
- And how it is related primary and foreigner keys
- Make it a thought explaining with examples

Understanding relationships in SQLAlchemy ORM can be simplified by thinking of them in terms of real-world associations between tables. SQLAlchemy uses relationships to link classes, which represent database tables, allowing you to interact with the data at a higher, more abstract level.

Let’s go through the basics and build up to more complex relationships with examples.

### Relationship Basics

In SQLAlchemy ORM, relationships are created using the `relationship` function, which defines how two classes are connected. Relationships are based on **primary keys** (unique identifiers) and **foreign keys** (references to primary keys in other tables).

The **abstract formula** for a relationship is:

```python
<attribute_name> = relationship("<RelatedClass>", back_populates="<back_reference>")
```

Where:

- **`<attribute_name>`**: The name of the attribute in the class representing the relationship. This can be anything meaningful, like `activities` in `Employee` to represent activities related to an employee.
- **`<RelatedClass>`**: The name of the class to which this class is related (enclosed in quotes).
- **`back_populates`**: Specifies the reciprocal attribute in the related class, forming a bidirectional relationship.

Now, let's explore how to create and understand different types of relationships: **One-to-One**, **One-to-Many**, and **Many-to-Many**.

---

### 1. One-to-One Relationship

In a **One-to-One relationship**, each record in Table A relates to exactly one record in Table B, and vice versa. An example would be `Employee` and `EmployeeProfile`, where each employee has exactly one profile.

#### Example

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

class Employee(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'employees'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    first_name = Column(String)

    # One-to-One relationship to EmployeeProfile
    profile = relationship("EmployeeProfile", back_populates="employee", uselist=False)

class EmployeeProfile(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'employee_profiles'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    employee_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('employees.id'))
    bio = Column(String)

    # Back-reference to Employee
    employee = relationship("Employee", back_populates="profile")
```

- **`uselist=False`** is required for a one-to-one relationship; it tells SQLAlchemy that `profile` should not be a list but a single object.
- **Foreign Key**: In `EmployeeProfile`, `employee_id` is a foreign key linking to `employees.id`.
- **Back-Populates**: `profile` in `Employee` links to `employee` in `EmployeeProfile`, allowing bidirectional access.

**Usage**:

- `employee.profile` gives the profile for an employee.
- `profile.employee` gives the employee associated with that profile.

---

### 2. One-to-Many Relationship

In a **One-to-Many relationship**, a record in Table A can relate to multiple records in Table B, but each record in Table B relates to only one record in Table A. An example is `Employee` and `EmployeeActivity`.

#### Example

```python
class Employee(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'employees'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    first_name = Column(String)

    # One-to-Many relationship to EmployeeActivity
    activities = relationship("EmployeeActivity", back_populates="employee")

class EmployeeActivity(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'employee_activities'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    employee_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('employees.id'))
    description = Column(String)

    # Back-reference to Employee
    employee = relationship("Employee", back_populates="activities")
```

- **Foreign Key**: In `EmployeeActivity`, `employee_id` is a foreign key linking back to `employees.id`.
- **Back-Populates**: `activities` in `Employee` links to `employee` in `EmployeeActivity`.

**Usage**:

- `employee.activities` returns a list of activities for an employee.
- `activity.employee` returns the employee associated with that activity.

---

### 3. Many-to-Many Relationship

In a **Many-to-Many relationship**, records in Table A can relate to multiple records in Table B, and records in Table B can relate to multiple records in Table A. This type of relationship requires an **association table** to handle the connections. An example would be `Student` and `Course`, where a student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.

#### Example

```python
from sqlalchemy import Table, Column, Integer, ForeignKey

# Association Table for Many-to-Many relationship
student_course = Table('student_course', Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)

    # Many-to-Many relationship to Course through association table
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_course, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)

    # Back-reference to Student
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_course, back_populates="courses")
```

- **Association Table**: `student_course` is an association table that connects `students` and `courses` through their respective primary keys.
- **`secondary` Parameter**: Specifies the association table to use.
- **Back-Populates**: `courses` in `Student` links to `students` in `Course`.

**Usage**:

- `student.courses` returns a list of courses the student is enrolled in.
- `course.students` returns a list of students enrolled in the course.

---

### Summary of Relationship Types

1. **One-to-One**: Use `relationship("<RelatedClass>", back_populates="<back_reference>", uselist=False)` and a foreign key.
2. **One-to-Many**: Use `relationship("<RelatedClass>", back_populates="<back_reference>")` in the "one" side and a foreign key in the "many" side.
3. **Many-to-Many**: Use an association table with `relationship("<RelatedClass>", secondary=<association_table>, back_populates="<back_reference>")`.

### Quick Reference Table

| Relationship Type | Primary/Foreign Key Setup                     | Example `relationship` Syntax                                                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One-to-One        | Foreign key in either table + `uselist=False` | `profile = relationship("EmployeeProfile", back_populates="employee", uselist=False)`   |
| One-to-Many       | Foreign key in the "many" table               | `activities = relationship("EmployeeActivity", back_populates="employee")`              |
| Many-to-Many      | Association table linking both primary keys   | `courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_course, back_populates="students")` |

By understanding these patterns, you can design relationships between any types
of tables in SQLAlchemy ORM, allowing you to manage and navigate complex data
structures in an intuitive way.

## Real life database and queries

- Assume i have a database and with three tables
- Assume they are car brand, car model, and car info
- Car info means several cars each with a district id
- Then you get an increment data of only the car info as a panda dataframe
- This comes with cars that modified status such as activity like sold, price reduced ..etc
- I want to add this increment to the car info table assume
- In this table many information for the car and it has a timestamp of activity
- So each car as a unique id but also has activity id, for all changes
- The info consists of static information such as engine size, color, ..etc
- While the car also has dynamic changes such as price, tags, removed from dealer website ..etc

To handle this scenario, where you have a database with `car_brand`, `car_model`, and `car_info` tables, and you receive incremental data updates for `car_info` as a `pandas.DataFrame`, you’ll need to carefully manage both static and dynamic information within the `car_info` table.

This requires:

1. **Unique Car Records**: Each car has a unique identifier (`car_id`).
2. **Activity Tracking**: For every change in car status (e.g., price change, status change), we’ll add a new record with a unique `activity_id`, a timestamp, and updated dynamic fields.
3. **Static vs. Dynamic Fields**: Separate static fields (like engine size and color) from dynamic fields (like price and status changes).

### Step 1: Define the Database Models

Here’s how you might set up the SQLAlchemy ORM models for this database, with `car_brand`, `car_model`, and `car_info` tables. We'll focus particularly on handling the `car_info` table to support incremental updates.

#### Database Models

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, Float, DateTime, ForeignKey, Boolean
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship, sessionmaker
from datetime import datetime

Base = declarative_base()

class CarBrand(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'car_brand'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)

    # One-to-Many relationship with CarModel
    models = relationship('CarModel', back_populates='brand')


class CarModel(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'car_model'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    brand_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('car_brand.id'), nullable=False)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)

    # Back-reference to CarBrand
    brand = relationship('CarBrand', back_populates='models')

    # One-to-Many relationship with CarInfo
    cars = relationship('CarInfo', back_populates='model')


class CarInfo(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'car_info'

    # Unique identifier for each car
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    car_id = Column(Integer, nullable=False)  # Unique ID for the car (e.g., VIN or platform-specific ID)
    model_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('car_model.id'), nullable=False)

    # Static fields
    engine_size = Column(Float)
    color = Column(String)

    # Dynamic fields
    price = Column(Float)
    status = Column(String)
    removed = Column(Boolean, default=False)  # If the car is removed from the platform
    timestamp = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)

    # Back-reference to CarModel
    model = relationship('CarModel', back_populates='cars')
```

### Step 2: Insert or Update Incremental Data

With the `CarInfo` table defined, we can handle incremental data updates by:

- **Inserting** a new record if it’s a new car.
- **Adding an entry** with the updated fields (price, status, etc.) and a new
  timestamp if an existing car’s dynamic data has changed.

Here’s how you might process the incremental data in a `pandas.DataFrame` and update the `car_info` table.

#### Sample Incremental Update DataFrame

Suppose you have an incremental DataFrame with updates like this:

```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

incremental_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'car_id': [101, 102, 101, 103],  # 101 and 102 are existing; 103 is new
    'engine_size': [2.0, 1.6, 2.0, 1.8],  # Static field
    'color': ['Red', 'Blue', 'Red', 'Black'],  # Static field
    'price': [25000, 20000, 24000, 23000],  # Dynamic field
    'status': ['available', 'sold', 'price reduced', 'available'],  # Dynamic field
    'removed': [False, True, False, False],  # Dynamic field
    'timestamp': [datetime.utcnow() for _ in range(4)]  # Timestamp of activity
})
```

#### Incremental Update Code

```python
# Set up the session
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

# Iterate through each row in the incremental data
for _, row in incremental_data.iterrows():
    car_id = row['car_id']

    # Check if the car already exists in the database
    existing_car = session.query(CarInfo).filter_by(car_id=car_id).order_by(CarInfo.timestamp.desc()).first()

    if existing_car:
        # If the car exists, check if dynamic fields have changed
        if (existing_car.price != row['price'] or
            existing_car.status != row['status'] or
            existing_car.removed != row['removed']):

            # Add a new record with the updated fields and a new timestamp
            new_activity = CarInfo(
                car_id=car_id,
                model_id=existing_car.model_id,  # Reuse model_id
                engine_size=existing_car.engine_size,  # Keep static info the same
                color=existing_car.color,  # Keep static info the same
                price=row['price'],  # Updated dynamic info
                status=row['status'],  # Updated dynamic info
                removed=row['removed'],  # Updated dynamic info
                timestamp=row['timestamp']
            )
            session.add(new_activity)
    else:
        # If the car is new, insert it as a new record
        new_car = CarInfo(
            car_id=car_id,
            model_id=1,  # Set an appropriate model_id based on brand/model lookup
            engine_size=row['engine_size'],
            color=row['color'],
            price=row['price'],
            status=row['status'],
            removed=row['removed'],
            timestamp=row['timestamp']
        )
        session.add(new_car)

# Commit the session to save changes
session.commit()
```

### Explanation

1. **Check for Existing Records**: For each car in the incremental data, we
   query the latest record (using `.order_by(CarInfo.timestamp.desc())`) to see
   if the car already exists.

2. **Update Dynamic Fields**: If the car exists and its dynamic fields have
   changed, we create a new `CarInfo` record with the same `car_id` but an
   updated `price`, `status`, or `removed` flag, and a new `timestamp`.

3. **Insert New Records**: If the car doesn’t exist, we insert it as a new
   record, using the provided static and dynamic fields.

### Managing Data over Time

Using this method, the `car_info` table will contain a history of each car's
state over time. This approach makes it easy to:

- Track price changes, sales, and removals over time.
- Analyze historical trends, such as average time on the platform before a car is sold.

By querying `car_info` for the latest `timestamp` per `car_id`, you can retrieve
the most recent information on each car.

## Is it effective to loop row by row like this?

Looping row by row in Python, especially when working with a `pandas.DataFrame`, can be inefficient, especially if the DataFrame has a large number of rows. In such cases, performing row-by-row operations can slow down the update process significantly. Fortunately, there are more efficient ways to handle bulk inserts or updates in SQLAlchemy.

### More Efficient Approaches

To improve performance, you can use **bulk inserts** or **bulk updates** and **batch queries** with SQLAlchemy. Here’s how you can refactor the code to be more efficient:

1. **Batch Fetch Existing Records**: Instead of checking for each `car_id` in a loop, retrieve all existing car records in a single query. You can then map them by `car_id` for faster lookups.
2. **Bulk Insert for New Records**: For new car records, you can insert all of them at once using SQLAlchemy’s `session.bulk_insert_mappings()`.
3. **Bulk Insert for Updated Records**: For cars that have changes in dynamic fields, you can add new activity records using `bulk_insert_mappings()` as well.

### Optimized Code Example

Here’s how you can implement this more efficient approach:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

# Set up the session
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///cars.db')
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

# Step 1: Retrieve existing records once
existing_cars = session.query(CarInfo).order_by(CarInfo.timestamp.desc()).all()

# Step 2: Create a dictionary of the latest car info for quick lookup by car_id
car_map = {}
for car in existing_cars:
    if car.car_id not in car_map:
        car_map[car.car_id] = car  # only keep the latest record per car_id

# Step 3: Separate new and updated records
new_records = []
updated_records = []

for _, row in incremental_data.iterrows():
    car_id = row['car_id']
    if car_id in car_map:
        # Existing car: check for changes in dynamic fields
        existing_car = car_map[car_id]
        if (existing_car.price != row['price'] or
            existing_car.status != row['status'] or
            existing_car.removed != row['removed']):
            # Prepare updated record
            updated_records.append({
                'car_id': car_id,
                'model_id': existing_car.model_id,  # Keep model_id consistent
                'engine_size': existing_car.engine_size,  # Keep static info the same
                'color': existing_car.color,  # Keep static info the same
                'price': row['price'],
                'status': row['status'],
                'removed': row['removed'],
                'timestamp': row['timestamp']
            })
    else:
        # New car record
        new_records.append({
            'car_id': car_id,
            'model_id': 1,  # Set model_id appropriately
            'engine_size': row['engine_size'],
            'color': row['color'],
            'price': row['price'],
            'status': row['status'],
            'removed': row['removed'],
            'timestamp': row['timestamp']
        })

# Step 4: Bulk insert new records
if new_records:
    session.bulk_insert_mappings(CarInfo, new_records)

# Step 5: Bulk insert updated records as new activity entries
if updated_records:
    session.bulk_insert_mappings(CarInfo, updated_records)

# Commit all changes
session.commit()
```

### Explanation of the Optimizations

1. **Single Query for Existing Records**: By fetching all existing `CarInfo`
   records in one query and storing the latest record for each `car_id` in a
   dictionary (`car_map`), we avoid querying the database repeatedly in a loop.
   This significantly reduces the number of database queries.

2. **Separate Lists for New and Updated Records**: We categorize records into
   `new_records` and `updated_records`, then perform bulk inserts for each
   category.

3. **Bulk Insert for Efficiency**: `session.bulk_insert_mappings()` is highly
   efficient for inserting multiple rows at once. It bypasses ORM object
   creation and directly maps dictionaries to columns, which speeds up the
   insert process.

### Benefits of this Approach

- **Reduced Database Calls**: Instead of querying the database for each row, we
  do a single query to fetch all existing car records.
- **Bulk Operations**: Inserting records in bulk reduces database overhead,
  making the process much faster.
- **Improved Readability**: The code is cleaner and easier to understand since
  we avoid complex logic inside the loop.

### When to Use Bulk Operations vs. Row-by-Row

- **Bulk Operations**: Ideal for large datasets where you need to insert or
  update many rows at once. This approach is efficient for both time and
  resource management.
- **Row-by-Row**: Suitable for scenarios where each row requires complex or
  conditional logic that can’t be batched. However, even in such cases, you can
  often optimize by pre-fetching required data.

By leveraging bulk operations and batch processing, this optimized code is far
more efficient and scalable, especially when handling large amounts of data in
your database.

## HINT - About Index

Can i also add index for fast and speed up also how about using redis database
for checking and loading the database for searching in case i want tj search the
car by id.
Yes, adding indexes and using a caching layer like Redis are excellent strategies to improve the performance of your application when working with large datasets.

### 1. Adding Indexes to Speed Up Queries

Indexes are a fundamental way to speed up database queries, especially for frequently accessed columns. For your use case, adding indexes on fields like `car_id` in the `car_info` table can significantly improve the speed of queries that filter by `car_id`.

In SQLAlchemy, you can add an index to a column by specifying the `index=True` argument:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, Float, DateTime, Boolean, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship, sessionmaker

Base = declarative_base()

class CarInfo(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'car_info'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    car_id = Column(Integer, nullable=False, index=True)  # Adding an index to car_id
    model_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('car_model.id'), nullable=False)

    # Static fields
    engine_size = Column(Float)
    color = Column(String)

    # Dynamic fields
    price = Column(Float)
    status = Column(String)
    removed = Column(Boolean, default=False)
    timestamp = Column(DateTime, index=True)  # Index for timestamp for fast sorting on updates

    model = relationship('CarModel', back_populates='cars')
```

- **`car_id` index**: This index will speed up lookups by `car_id`, which is especially useful for fetching individual car records or checking existence.
- **`timestamp` index**: If you frequently query or sort by the latest timestamp, an index on `timestamp` can improve performance when retrieving recent records.

Indexes make searching and filtering operations faster but may slightly slow down insertions and updates due to the need to update the index. So, consider indexing columns that you often use in search conditions or as join keys.

### 2. Using Redis for Faster Lookups and Caching

Redis is an in-memory data store that can be used as a caching layer to reduce database load and speed up frequently accessed data. For example, you can use Redis to cache `car_info` records, allowing quick lookups by `car_id` without hitting the main database each time.

Here’s how you might use Redis for this scenario:

- **Step 1**: Set up a Redis cache where each `car_id` maps to the corresponding `car_info` data.
- **Step 2**: On each request, first check Redis for the `car_id`. If found, use the cached result; if not, query the database and then store the result in Redis for future requests.

#### Example Implementation

Assuming you have a Redis server running, here’s an example of how to integrate Redis with SQLAlchemy for caching:

```python
import redis
import json
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

# Set up Redis connection
redis_client = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0, decode_responses=True)

# Set up SQLAlchemy session
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///cars.db')
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

def get_car_info(car_id):
    # Check Redis cache first
    cached_car = redis_client.get(f"car_info:{car_id}")

    if cached_car:
        # Return the cached result
        return json.loads(cached_car)

    # If not in cache, query the database
    car = session.query(CarInfo).filter_by(car_id=car_id).order_by(CarInfo.timestamp.desc()).first()

    if car:
        # Store result in Redis cache with a timeout (e.g., 10 minutes)
        car_data = {
            "car_id": car.car_id,
            "model_id": car.model_id,
            "engine_size": car.engine_size,
            "color": car.color,
            "price": car.price,
            "status": car.status,
            "removed": car.removed,
            "timestamp": car.timestamp.isoformat()
        }
        redis_client.setex(f"car_info:{car_id}", 600, json.dumps(car_data))  # Cache for 10 minutes
        return car_data
    else:
        return None
```

### Explanation

1. **Cache Check**: `redis_client.get(f"car_info:{car_id}")` attempts to
   retrieve the `car_info` from Redis. If found, it returns the cached data,
   avoiding a database query.
2. **Database Query**: If the data isn’t in the cache, it queries the SQLAlchemy
   session.
3. **Cache Update**: After querying the database, it stores the result in Redis
   with `setex`, which includes a timeout (in this case, 600 seconds or 10
   minutes) to keep the cache fresh and prevent stale data from persisting.

### Benefits of Using Redis

- **Reduced Database Load**: Frequently accessed data is served from Redis,
  reducing the number of database queries.
- **Faster Lookups**: Redis can serve data much faster than a traditional
  disk-based database since it stores data in memory.
- **Automatic Expiration**: The timeout on cache entries helps prevent stale
  data from being used, especially for dynamic fields like price and status.

### Additional Considerations

1. **Cache Invalidation**: When car information updates, you need to invalidate
   or update the Redis cache to prevent stale data. For example, if a car's
   `price` or `status` changes, you can update the Redis cache at the same time
   as the database.
2. **Data Serialization**: Redis stores data as strings, so complex data like
   `datetime` needs to be serialized (e.g., converting timestamps to ISO format
   strings) when caching and deserialized when reading from Redis.

3. **Using Redis with SQLAlchemy Events**: You can use SQLAlchemy’s event system
   to automatically update or invalidate the cache when data is inserted,
   updated, or deleted from the `car_info` table. This keeps Redis in sync with
   the database.

### Summary

- **Indexes**: Adding indexes on frequently queried columns like `car_id` and
  `timestamp` in `car_info` can speed up lookups and sorting significantly.
- **Redis Caching**: Redis serves as an efficient in-memory caching solution to
  reduce database load and accelerate frequently accessed queries, especially
  when searching by `car_id`.

Using these methods together allows for a highly efficient database design that
minimizes the impact of frequent reads and updates on performance. This setup is
particularly useful for applications with large datasets and real-time search
requirements.
