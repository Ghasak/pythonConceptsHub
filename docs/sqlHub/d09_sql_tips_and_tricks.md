## Tip -1

What are all possible ways to create a table from an existed table in sql native
synatx In SQL, there are several ways to create a new table based on an existing
table. These methods allow you to copy the structure, data, or both, and they
can be tailored depending on your needs.

### 1. **Create Table with Structure and Data**

You can create a new table with both the structure and data of an existing table using:

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
SELECT * FROM existing_table;
```

This method copies both the structure and the data from `existing_table` to `new_table`.

### 2. **Create Table with Structure Only (No Data)**

To create a new table with the structure of an existing table but without
copying the data, use a `WHERE` clause that results in no rows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
SELECT * FROM existing_table WHERE 1 = 0;
```

This creates an empty table with the same columns and data types as `existing_table`.

### 3. **Create Table with Selected Columns**

If you only need certain columns from the existing table, specify them in the `SELECT` statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM existing_table;
```

This copies only the selected columns and their data.

### 4. **Create Table with Structure and Selected Data (Using WHERE)**

To create a table with both structure and a subset of data from the existing table, use a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
SELECT * FROM existing_table WHERE column1 = 'some_value';
```

This creates a new table with the same columns as `existing_table` but only includes rows that match the condition.

### 5. **Create Table with Modified Structure (Using Expressions or Calculations)**

You can modify the structure by including expressions or calculated columns in the `SELECT` statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
SELECT column1, column2 * 2 AS double_column2 FROM existing_table;
```

This creates a new table with `column1` and a calculated column `double_column2` based on `column2`.

### 6. **Create Table with Aggregated Data**

You can also create a new table with aggregated data from an existing table using aggregate functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, etc., along with `GROUP BY`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
SELECT column1, SUM(column2) AS total_column2
FROM existing_table
GROUP BY column1;
```

This creates a table with aggregated data based on `column1`.

### 7. **Copy Table Structure with `LIKE` (SQL Server, PostgreSQL)**

Some SQL dialects, like PostgreSQL, allow the use of `LIKE` to copy only the structure of an existing table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table (LIKE existing_table);
```

This copies the column definitions and constraints but does not copy data.

### 8. **Create Table as a Temporary Table**

If you only need a temporary copy of a table for a session, you can create a temporary table. In some databases (like PostgreSQL and MySQL), you can specify `TEMPORARY`:

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table AS
SELECT * FROM existing_table;
```

This table will only exist for the duration of the session.

### 9. **Create Table with Inherited Structure (PostgreSQL)**

In PostgreSQL, you can create a table that inherits the structure of an existing table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table (LIKE existing_table INCLUDING ALL);
```

This includes column definitions, constraints, and indexes, and allows for inheritance of structure.

### 10. **Clone Table Including Constraints (Oracle)**

In Oracle, you can create a table based on an existing one and include constraints with `AS SELECT`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
SELECT * FROM existing_table WHERE 1=0;
ALTER TABLE new_table ADD CONSTRAINT ... ;
```

The constraints need to be added after the table creation, as `AS SELECT` alone does not include constraints.

### Summary

Here’s a quick summary of the methods:

- **Structure and Data**: `CREATE TABLE new_table AS SELECT * FROM existing_table;`
- **Structure Only**: `CREATE TABLE new_table AS SELECT * FROM existing_table WHERE 1 = 0;`
- **Selected Columns Only**: `CREATE TABLE new_table AS SELECT column1, column2 FROM existing_table;`
- **Filtered Data**: `CREATE TABLE new_table AS SELECT * FROM existing_table WHERE column1 = 'value';`
- **Modified Structure**: `CREATE TABLE new_table AS SELECT column1, column2 * 2 AS double_column2 FROM existing_table;`
- **Aggregated Data**: `CREATE TABLE new_table AS SELECT column1, SUM(column2) FROM existing_table GROUP BY column1;`
- **Copy Structure with LIKE (PostgreSQL)**: `CREATE TABLE new_table (LIKE existing_table);`
- **Temporary Table**: `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table AS SELECT * FROM existing_table;`
- **Inheritance (PostgreSQL)**: `CREATE TABLE new_table (LIKE existing_table INCLUDING ALL);`

These methods provide flexibility to create a new table tailored to specific
needs. Let me know if you’d like more details on any specific method.

### CASE

Using `CASE` in `CREATE TABLE AS` allows you to create a new table with
conditional expressions based on values in an existing table. Here’s how you can
incorporate `CASE` to modify the structure of a new table based on conditions in
the data.

### Example: Creating a Table with `CASE`

You can use `CASE` within the `SELECT` statement to conditionally modify data when creating the new table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
SELECT
    column1,
    column2,
    CASE
        WHEN column3 > 100 THEN 'High'
        WHEN column3 BETWEEN 50 AND 100 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END AS column3_category
FROM
    existing_table;
```

### Explanation

In this example:

- `new_table` will be created with the columns `column1`, `column2`, and a new column `column3_category`.
- `column3_category` is derived from `column3` in `existing_table`:
  - If `column3` is greater than 100, `column3_category` will be `'High'`.
  - If `column3` is between 50 and 100, `column3_category` will be `'Medium'`.
  - Otherwise, it will be `'Low'`.

### More Complex `CASE` Example with Multiple Conditions

You can expand `CASE` to handle more complex logic with multiple conditions.

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
SELECT
    column1,
    column2,
    CASE
        WHEN column3 IS NULL THEN 'Unknown'
        WHEN column3 > 100 THEN 'High'
        WHEN column3 BETWEEN 50 AND 100 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END AS column3_category,
    CASE
        WHEN column4 = 'A' THEN 'Category A'
        WHEN column4 = 'B' THEN 'Category B'
        ELSE 'Other'
    END AS column4_label
FROM
    existing_table;
```

### Summary

Using `CASE` in `CREATE TABLE AS` allows you to transform data on the fly while
copying it to a new table. This can be useful for data categorization, label
assignment, or handling missing data in specific ways. Let me know if you’d like
additional examples!

## Tip -2

So assume i have first name and second name and i want to create a column of full name how to do that?

To create a new column `full_name` that combines `first_name` and `last_name`, you can use string concatenation in SQL when creating a new table. Here are a few approaches depending on the SQL dialect you're using.

### General SQL Syntax (Using `||` for Concatenation)

Most SQL databases support concatenation with `||`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name,
    first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name
FROM
    existing_table;
```

In this example:

- `first_name || ' ' || last_name` combines `first_name` and `last_name` with a space between them to form `full_name`.

### MySQL Syntax (Using `CONCAT` Function)

In MySQL, you can use the `CONCAT` function:

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name,
    CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
FROM
    existing_table;
```

### SQL Server Syntax (Using `+` for Concatenation)

In SQL Server, the `+` operator is used for string concatenation:

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name,
    first_name + ' ' + last_name AS full_name
FROM
    existing_table;
```

### PostgreSQL Syntax (Using `||` for Concatenation)

In PostgreSQL, you can use `||` for concatenation, similar to the general SQL syntax:

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name,
    first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name
FROM
    existing_table;
```

### Explanation

In each case:

- `first_name` and `last_name` are combined with a space between them to form the `full_name` column.
- The `full_name` column is created in the `new_table` based on data in `existing_table`.

This approach will create a new table with `first_name`, `last_name`, and `full_name` columns. Let me know if you have specific requirements or if your database uses a different syntax!

### Explanation of Each Operation

- **Concatenation**: Combines two or more columns or strings. Different functions/operators are used based on the SQL dialect.
- **Substring**: Extracts a specific portion of a string. Specify the starting position and length of the substring.
- **Lowercase/Uppercase**: Converts a string to lowercase or uppercase.
- **Trim**: Removes spaces (or specific characters) from the beginning and/or end of a string. SQL Server uses a combination of `LTRIM` and `RTRIM` for full trimming.
- **Length of String**: Returns the length (number of characters) in a string.
- **Replace**: Replaces occurrences of a substring within a string with another substring.
- **Position of Substring**: Finds the position of a substring within a string. SQL Server uses `CHARINDEX`, while Oracle uses `INSTR`.
- **Left/Right Padding**: Pads the string on the left or right to a specific length using a specified padding character.
- **Reverse String**: Reverses the order of characters in a string.
- **Concatenate Multiple with Separator**: Concatenates multiple columns with a specified separator (e.g., space).

This table gives a quick reference for these common string operations across various SQL databases. Let me know if you'd like examples of any specific operation!

## Tip -4

Give me all possible ways to create column based on computing and mathematical formula from other columns?
In SQL, you can create new columns based on calculations or mathematical formulas derived from other columns. Here are various operations and functions for creating computed columns, which can be used either in `SELECT` statements or in creating new tables.

### Arithmetic Operations

1. **Addition**: Adds values from two columns.

   ```sql
   SELECT column1 + column2 AS total FROM table_name;
   ```

2. **Subtraction**: Subtracts values from one column by another.

   ```sql
   SELECT column1 - column2 AS difference FROM table_name;
   ```

3. **Multiplication**: Multiplies values of two columns.

   ```sql
   SELECT column1 * column2 AS product FROM table_name;
   ```

4. **Division**: Divides values from one column by another.

   ```sql
   SELECT column1 / column2 AS ratio FROM table_name;
   ```

5. **Modulus (Remainder)**: Returns the remainder of division.
   ```sql
   SELECT column1 % column2 AS remainder FROM table_name;  -- Supported in SQL Server and PostgreSQL
   SELECT MOD(column1, column2) AS remainder FROM table_name; -- General SQL syntax
   ```

### Aggregate Functions on Columns

1. **SUM**: Calculates the sum of a column (used with `GROUP BY` for aggregation).

   ```sql
   SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department;
   ```

2. **AVG**: Calculates the average value of a column.

   ```sql
   SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department;
   ```

3. **MIN/MAX**: Finds the minimum or maximum value in a column.

   ```sql
   SELECT department, MIN(salary) AS min_salary, MAX(salary) AS max_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department;
   ```

4. **COUNT**: Counts the number of entries.
   ```sql
   SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count FROM employees GROUP BY department;
   ```

### Mathematical Functions

1. **Square Root**: Calculates the square root of a column.

   ```sql
   SELECT SQRT(column1) AS sqrt_value FROM table_name;
   ```

2. **Power**: Raises a column to a specified power.

   ```sql
   SELECT POWER(column1, 2) AS square_value FROM table_name; -- column1^2
   ```

3. **Absolute Value**: Returns the absolute value of a column.

   ```sql
   SELECT ABS(column1) AS absolute_value FROM table_name;
   ```

4. **Logarithm**: Computes the natural logarithm or logarithm to a base.

   ```sql
   SELECT LOG(column1) AS natural_log FROM table_name;       -- Natural log
   SELECT LOG10(column1) AS log_base_10 FROM table_name;     -- Log base 10
   ```

5. **Exponential**: Computes the exponential (e^value) of a column.

   ```sql
   SELECT EXP(column1) AS exponential_value FROM table_name;
   ```

6. **Rounding**:
   - **Round**: Rounds to a specified number of decimal places.
     ```sql
     SELECT ROUND(column1, 2) AS rounded_value FROM table_name; -- Rounds to 2 decimal places
     ```
   - **Ceiling**: Rounds up to the nearest integer.
     ```sql
     SELECT CEIL(column1) AS ceiling_value FROM table_name;
     ```
   - **Floor**: Rounds down to the nearest integer.
     ```sql
     SELECT FLOOR(column1) AS floor_value FROM table_name;
     ```

### Conditional (CASE) Based Computed Column

You can create a column based on conditions using `CASE`.

```sql
SELECT
    column1,
    column2,
    CASE
        WHEN column1 + column2 > 100 THEN 'High'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END AS level
FROM table_name;
```

### Percentage Calculations

1. **Percentage of a Value**:

   ```sql
   SELECT (column1 / total_column) * 100 AS percentage FROM table_name;
   ```

2. **Percentage Difference**:
   ```sql
   SELECT ((column1 - column2) / column2) * 100 AS percent_change FROM table_name;
   ```

### Date and Time Calculations

1. **Date Difference**: Calculate the difference in days between two dates.

   ```sql
   SELECT DATEDIFF(day, start_date, end_date) AS days_difference FROM table_name;  -- SQL Server
   SELECT end_date - start_date AS days_difference FROM table_name;                 -- PostgreSQL
   SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, start_date, end_date) AS days_difference FROM table_name; -- MySQL
   ```

2. **Adding/Subtracting Intervals**: Add or subtract time intervals from a date.
   ```sql
   SELECT start_date + INTERVAL '1 year' AS next_year FROM table_name;  -- PostgreSQL
   SELECT DATE_ADD(start_date, INTERVAL 1 YEAR) AS next_year FROM table_name; -- MySQL
   ```

### Statistical Functions (if supported)

Some databases support statistical functions natively, but these are not always available.

1. **Variance**:

   ```sql
   SELECT VARIANCE(column1) AS variance_value FROM table_name;  -- MySQL
   SELECT VAR_SAMP(column1) AS variance_value FROM table_name;  -- PostgreSQL
   ```

2. **Standard Deviation**:
   ```sql
   SELECT STDDEV(column1) AS stddev_value FROM table_name;  -- MySQL, PostgreSQL
   ```

### Creating a New Table with Calculated Columns

You can use any of these computed columns when creating a new table. Here’s an example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
SELECT
    column1,
    column2,
    column1 + column2 AS sum,
    column1 - column2 AS difference,
    SQRT(column1) AS sqrt_column1,
    CASE
        WHEN column1 + column2 > 100 THEN 'High'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END AS level
FROM
    existing_table;
```

This will create `new_table` with computed columns such as `sum`, `difference`,
`sqrt_column1`, and `level` based on calculations and conditions from
`existing_table`.

These are the primary ways to create calculated columns from other columns in
SQL. Let me know if you'd like more examples or any specific computations!

## Tip -5

Assume i have a column with a name number of cars scrapped on 20241105 and i
want to create a column by this timestamp only each row should have this
timestamp. If you have a column named something like
`number_of_cars_scrapped_on_20241105`, and you want to extract just the date
(`20241105`) as a new column, you can do this by creating a computed column that
assigns this date to each row.

Here’s how you could achieve this in SQL:

### Example

Assuming your original table is named `car_scrap_data`, and you want to create a
new column called `scrap_date` with the timestamp `2024-11-05` (in `YYYY-MM-DD`
format).

#### Method 1: Using a Static Value in a `SELECT` Query

If you’re simply querying the table, you can add a static date column by
specifying it directly in the `SELECT` statement.

```sql
SELECT
    number_of_cars_scrapped_on_20241105,
    '2024-11-05' AS scrap_date
FROM
    car_scrap_data;
```

This adds a new column `scrap_date` with the date `2024-11-05` in each row.

#### Method 2: Creating a New Table with the Timestamp Column

If you want to create a new table that includes this timestamp as a static
column, you can use a `CREATE TABLE AS` statement.

```sql
CREATE TABLE car_scrap_with_date AS
SELECT
    number_of_cars_scrapped_on_20241105,
    '2024-11-05' AS scrap_date
FROM
    car_scrap_data;
```

This will create a new table called `car_scrap_with_date` with two columns:

- `number_of_cars_scrapped_on_20241105`
- `scrap_date` (with a static date of `2024-11-05`)

#### Method 3: Adding a Computed Column in SQL Server or MySQL

If you’re using SQL Server or MySQL and want to add a computed column to your
existing table, you can use `ALTER TABLE` to add a computed column.

```sql
ALTER TABLE car_scrap_data
ADD scrap_date AS ('2024-11-05');
```

In this case, `scrap_date` will always display `2024-11-05` for each row.

### Explanation

In each of these methods:

- We specify `'2024-11-05'` directly, which adds the date as a constant value in
  each row.
- This is helpful if the date represents a static piece of metadata associated
  with the rows.

These approaches work across most SQL databases and achieve the goal of adding a
date column derived from the column name. Let me know if you need variations or
additional help with specific database dialects!

## Tip -6

- I want to be automated not by typing the timestamp. To automate the process of
  extracting the timestamp from the column name itself without manually typing it,
  you can use SQL functions or procedural code to dynamically generate this value.
  Since SQL itself does not natively support extracting values directly from
  column names, here are some strategies to automate this, depending on the SQL
  environment and database you're using.

### Option 1: Using SQL Views and Dynamic SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)

1. **Extract Date from Column Name**: Use a script to dynamically extract the
   date from the column name and generate a `scrap_date` column based on this
   extracted date.

2. **Create a View with Dynamic SQL**: Use procedural SQL (e.g., PL/pgSQL in
   PostgreSQL, T-SQL in SQL Server) to dynamically generate a view or table with
   the desired date.

#### Example (PostgreSQL)

In PostgreSQL, you could use PL/pgSQL to create a dynamic view that automatically extracts the date from the column name.

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
    column_date TEXT;
BEGIN
    -- Extract date from the column name
    SELECT regexp_replace(column_name, '\D+', '', 'g')
    INTO column_date
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name = 'car_scrap_data' AND column_name LIKE 'number_of_cars_scrapped_on_%';

    -- Generate the view with extracted date
    EXECUTE format($sql$
        CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW car_scrap_with_date AS
        SELECT
            number_of_cars_scrapped_on_%I AS number_of_cars_scrapped,
            TO_DATE(%L, 'YYYYMMDD') AS scrap_date
        FROM
            car_scrap_data;
    $sql$, column_date, column_date);
END $$;
```

In this example:

- The `regexp_replace` function extracts digits from the column name
  `number_of_cars_scrapped_on_20241105`, giving `20241105`.
- The `TO_DATE` function converts `20241105` to `2024-11-05`.
- The `EXECUTE format` function creates a view with the extracted date.

This approach will dynamically create a view with a `scrap_date` column derived
from the column name.

### Option 2: Using Python or Another Scripting Language

If you want to fully automate this process and apply it to any column name, you
can use Python (or another scripting language) to extract the timestamp from the
column name and then dynamically generate the SQL code.

#### Example in Python

Here’s a Python script that connects to the database, extracts the timestamp
from the column name, and then runs a query to create a new table with the
extracted date.

```python
import re
import psycopg2

# Connect to the database
conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=your_db user=your_user password=your_password")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Get the column name dynamically
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT column_name
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name = 'car_scrap_data' AND column_name LIKE 'number_of_cars_scrapped_on_%'
""")
column_name = cursor.fetchone()[0]

# Extract the date from the column name
date_str = re.search(r'\d+', column_name).group()
formatted_date = f"{date_str[:4]}-{date_str[4:6]}-{date_str[6:]}"

# Create the new table with the extracted date as a constant column
create_table_sql = f"""
    CREATE TABLE car_scrap_with_date AS
    SELECT
        {column_name} AS number_of_cars_scrapped,
        '{formatted_date}'::DATE AS scrap_date
    FROM
        car_scrap_data;
"""

cursor.execute(create_table_sql)
conn.commit()

# Close the connection
cursor.close()
conn.close()
```

In this Python example:

- The script queries the column name from the database and uses a regular expression to extract the timestamp.
- It formats the extracted timestamp into a `YYYY-MM-DD` date.
- It then creates a new table `car_scrap_with_date` with the extracted date as the `scrap_date` column.

### Option 3: Using Database Triggers (if Column Name Changes Over Time)

For a fully dynamic solution that responds to changes in column names, you could
use database triggers in some environments (e.g., SQL Server) to automate the
generation of this column based on the column name. However, triggers can be
complex to set up and maintain, and they are not typically used for this
purpose.

### Summary

- **Option 1**: Use PL/pgSQL or T-SQL to automate view creation based on
  extracted date.
- **Option 2**: Use a scripting language like Python to query the column name,
  extract the date, and generate the table.
- **Option 3**: Consider database triggers if the column name changes frequently
  (although this is less common).

These solutions help automate the process without hardcoding the date. Let me
know if you need more details on any specific approach!
